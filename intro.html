    <p>
      Customer Relationship Management (CRM) is considered one of the top business management methods and tools. 
      Traditionally, CRM systems have been used mostly for sales, but today they are also widely used for marketing 
      and customer service.
      <br><br>
      Before cloud computing, CRM software was expensive and difficult to learn, so it was mostly used by large 
      companies. Today, however, there are freemium-style CRM systems that are easy to use.
    </p>

    <h4>
      How does business work without CRM?
    </h4>

    <p>
      It is common to record user data in Excel and use an email contact database. Although it generates user data, 
      it is not an online information system for team use.
      <br><br>
      Let's take an example of a company that provides human resources consulting services. Let them conduct 
      activities such as providing consulting services to organizations to improve human resource management, 
      automating human resource activities by introducing HRM, conducting head hunting to find suitable employees 
      for important positions, and conducting professional training for human resource employees and managers.
      <br><br>
      Starting from organizing trainings and conferences, it is necessary to register the information of potential 
      users. It is common to take registrations over the phone and keep records in Excel. Alternatively, you can 
      automate your registration by placing a google form on your website.
      <br><br>
      In order to provide human resources consulting services, it is necessary to meet with the human resources 
      managers and executives of the organization, to make phone calls, to make presentations, to develop proposals, 
      to negotiate contracts, and to do this, it is necessary to use e-mail, notebooks, office applications, mobile 
      phones, and messengers. On the one hand, it seems like it is happening, but the data of the organization, 
      the user, and the relationships created are not gathered at once, they are scattered here and there. Some 
      information is not even stored, so it doesn't exist.
      <br><br>
      This is where CRM systems come into play. Who is the user, how can they be contacted, when and what kind of 
      relationship with us was created, what results were achieved, what purchases were made, and what was the 
      reason for not making a purchase? can make it more efficient, correct and effective. Because we have a CRM, 
      when a customer calls me on the phone, I see not only who the person is, but also their past relationship 
      with us, which helps make the call more rewarding for both parties.
    </p>

    <h4>
      What should be considered when having a CRM system?
    </h4>

    <p>
      Many Mongolian companies often make mistakes by developing CRM software for themselves. At that time, it is 
      still in use and put into operation, but after 2 or 3 years, it is delayed and no longer meets the needs, 
      and additional costs are required for modification and correction of program errors. It is recommended to 
      spend more attention, money and effort on implementing CRM in your operations than on software development.
      <br><br>
      The most important thing is that determining how to develop and improve further requires knowledge, 
      experience, time, effort and money, so it is the right choice to choose and use a solution based on 
      cloud computing that is more suitable for your needs.
      <br><br>
      Cloud-based CRM applications are used by millions of users every day, so they are already standardized, 
      incorporate the best practices of many organizations, and change and evolve daily to reflect technological 
      and management advances. Only people who know how to do sales can make a decent CRM.
      <br><br>

      CRM for free? read the article.
      <br><br>
      There is a high risk of failure when implementing a CRM system, which depends not only on technology but 
      also on human factors. How it can be solved Why is it difficult to implement CRM in sales? read the article.
    </p>

    <h4>
      Customer database and segmentation
    </h4>

    <p>
      It is a good idea to record the segments of potential users in CRM, such as those who called your company by 
      phone, visited, gave their business cards at a conference, contacted via messenger, received information from 
      a chatbot, filled out a website form, registered for training, recommended by someone they know, etc.
      <br><br>
      The process of recording and creating data and information should be automated as much as possible. Manual 
      registration is time-consuming, error-prone, and data is likely to be discarded. Automation features include:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Data such as phone numbers, selected menus, voice recordings and SMS messages can be generated from 
        corporate and mobile calls.
      </li>

      <li>
        Register information from Facebook. How to log user data from Facebook? The article explains how in detail. 
        This ad called Facebook Lead Generation is used very sparingly by organizations. Data is generated 
        automatically because it connects directly to CRM systems like HubSpot.
      </li>

      <li>
        Register from Messenger. By connecting your CRM system to the messenger, data such as last name, first name, 
        photo, gender, and PSID number of the users who accessed the page's messenger will be generated.
      </li>

      <li>
        Registration of information with messenger chatbot. It is possible to create a bot in Facebook Messenger, 
        collect user information, and automatically register by connecting to the CRM system.
      </li>

      <li>
        A chat bot on a website can also log information.
      </li>

      <li>
        User data completed by uploading forms to the website can be automatically recorded into the CRM. For 
        example, let's say that the template of the internal procedure of the organization is uploaded for download. 
        Since it is a free template, you can fill in the information such as name, phone, e-mail, company name, 
        position, etc. and download it to collect the data you need. When uploading a performance appraisal manual 
        for download, you can add information such as HR management issues, industry, number of employees, etc. If 
        the person, for example, I download either template or manual, you will have information that Batzorig has 
        such a phone number and e-mail, BZP is the director of the company, and they have about the same number of 
        employees. In other words, users themselves enter their data into your database.
      </li>

      <li>
        Register information through a pop-up window. As above, it can be done in the form of presentations and 
        content downloads. Or, if you want to receive news, information, and recommendations from your industry, 
        sign up for an email, or request a quote, schedule an appointment, or request an appointment. It's 
        relatively easy to add to a website.
      </li>

      <li>
        Integration with information systems. By integrating with the online shop, ERP, and the core system, data 
        can be generated automatically in the CRM system. CRM systems can be integrated based on API interfaces or 
        using IPAAS solutions such as Make (formerly Integromat).
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Segments may or may not have made a purchase and become your customer or customer. Just because you didn't 
      make a purchase doesn't mean you shouldn't record it in the CRM system at all. If not today, then next month, 
      if not next month, then next year.
      <br><br>
      With a rich and data-rich CRM customer database, marketing teams can use that data to segment and re-engage 
      customers, optimize advertising, and measure performance.
    </p>

    <h4>
      Manages all interactions with customers
    </h4>

    <p>
      A CRM system helps you more successfully manage your various customer relationships, rather than just what 
      products and how much you're selling. If you know who your customer is, what kind of relationship they had 
      before, what they bought, what suggestions and complaints were made, when and how they were resolved, you can 
      maintain more effective marketing, sales, and service relationships with that customer. .
      <br><br>
      You might think that we know a few of our customers well. But no good mind can remember everything in his head. 
      The larger the team, the less likely it is. Some of the above information remains as data in some way, but some 
      of it is in the head, some in a notebook or mobile phone, maybe on an app, or in the page messenger and e-mail 
      inbox, hard drive, some on your colleague's phone, computer, remain on notebooks, programs, and apps. If a 
      purchase is made, a little more data remains, if not, almost no data is left. But people who haven't made any 
      purchases come this year.
      <br><br>
      When an employee changes, it is often the case that all the information goes with them.
      <br><br>
      By using a Customer Relationship Management system, you can manage the following relationships:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Phone call. Save the content of your important calls to log every time. If you use the CallPro program for 
        managing company numbers, a call recording log will be created automatically.
      </li>

      <li>
        SMS messages. If you use MessagePro, the CRM will automatically log messages sent to the customer. By 
        connecting your Android smartphone, you can automatically log your call history and sent and received SMS 
        messages.
      </li>

      <li>
        Minutes of the meeting. Log the content and minutes of meetings. Use the calendar to schedule appointments 
        and manage your meetings. By connecting Google Calendar and Zoom, the user can even schedule an online 
        meeting by choosing from your free time in your calendar.
      </li>

      <li>
        Connect your email to automatically log in and access CRM from within your email program.
      </li>

      <li>
        Messenger chat. Log Facebook Messenger and Web Chat conversations.
      </li>

      <li>
        Sales contract. Crucial to sales success, managing this relationship step-by-step in CRM helps you make 
        more sales faster.
      </li>

      <li>
        Suggestions, complaints and technical support. It is important to create and manage tickets to register 
        complaints from customers, buyers, and clients and to resolve them with a responsible owner. It means that 
        customer complaints disappear like a stone thrown into the water.
      </li>

      <li>
        Others. Contracts, quotes, orders, invoices, accounts receivable, and many other types of relationships 
        can also exist.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Not only the customer, but also the communication within the team is an important part of customer 
      communication. A CRM system can take advantage of teamwork because multiple users can access it at the 
      same time.
    </p>

    <h4>
      CRM systems increase productivity
    </h4>

    <p>
      Increased productivity increases sales and lowers costs for any organization. In other words, 
      increase profitability. CRM system for example:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        In particular, using a cloud-based CRM increases teamwork opportunities with access from anywhere at any 
        time and on any device.
      </li>

      <li>
        Simplify searching and filtering to help you find your customers faster and get information faster. By 
        distinguishing by price, you can create the right relationship with the potential customer at the right time.
      </li>

      <li>
        Task management in the CRM system increases the possibility of doing important tasks on time 
        without leaving them behind.
      </li>

      <li>
        With automation, it is possible to assign a lead hand-off to a sales representative of a potential customer 
        at that moment, and create a task to work on, without human intervention.
      </li>

      <li>
        By doing deal management, you will "chasing" sales opportunities without losing them.
      </li>

      <li>
        The use of various templates and snippets simplifies not only e-mail, messenger chat, SMS communication, 
        but also call logging.
      </li>

      <li>
        Use the calendar to improve the management of appointments, meetings and conferences. The user can select 
        a free time in your calendar and schedule an appointment without your presence.
      </li>

      <li>
        You can use your CRM on the go with a mobile app.
      </li>

      <li>
        Real-time access to sales progress and forecast data from a dashboard is available to help you 
        make the right decisions quickly.
      </li>
    </ul>
