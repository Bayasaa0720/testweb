          SRM vs CRM software: What's the difference?
        </h3>

        <p>
          Customer Relationship Management (CRM) software and Stakeholder Relationship Management (SRM) software are 
          both used to manage the interactions between a company and the people who have the potential to affect the 
          organization’s outcomes. Some companies attempt to customize their CRM for managing stakeholder engagement 
          activities.
          <br><br>
          In reality, SRM and CRM software are not interchangeable; they serve very different objectives. But what’s 
          the difference between SRM and CRM systems… and which one is right for you?
        </p>

        <h3>
          What is SRM software?
        </h3>

        <p>
          SRM, or Stakeholder Relationship Management software – sometimes called a stakeholder management system – 
          is a tool that helps companies manage all information related to their stakeholder engagement efforts over 
          the life of a project. It is designed to help companies manage stakeholder relationships and monitor how 
          these change over time as they work to secure project social acceptance.
          <br><br>
          Stakeholder relationships are usually more complex and less predictable than customer relationships. 
          SRM software is designed to consider these factors while promoting transparency and open communication.
        </p>

        <h4>
          Primary uses for SRM software
        </h4>

          <li>
            <strong style="color: #8f30dc;">Coal and mineral mining</strong> – To avoid the potential of millions of dollars per day in delays, lack of 
            permitting, or closure, the coal and mining industry must build social acceptance and trust with

        <h4>
          Benefits of Stakeholder Relationship Management Software
        </h4>

        <p>
          SRM software is developed for stakeholder engagement specifically. CRM software is sometimes tweaked to 
          include stakeholders other than customers, but that approach often fails.
        </p>

        <h3>
          What is CRM software?
        </h3>

        <p>
          Customer Relationship Management software is a tool that stores sales-related information, such as leads, 
          contacts, opportunities, and purchase history. CRM software to helps companies improve business 
          relationships and move customers through the sales funnel.
        </p>

        <h4>
          Who uses CRM software and why?
        </h4>

        <p>
          Many different industries use CRM software to manage customer relationships, including:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong style="color: #8f30dc;">Retail and eCommerce</strong> - Businesses use data about retail 
            customers to understand purchasing patterns, build customer profiles, track and respond to complaints, 
            unify customer support and service interfaces, and manage inventory.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong style="color: #8f30dc;">Hospitality</strong> - Hotels and restaurants can use a CRM to track 
            customer patronage, respond to concerns and complaints, nurture customer loyalty, and handle everyday 
            tasks like booking reservations.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong style="color: #8f30dc;">Banking and other financial services</strong> - Financial organizations 
            use CRMs to classify customers based on their needs. While some customers only need basic products 
            (like checking or savings accounts), others may require a wide range of products and services. 
            Classifying customers according to their needs helps the organization identify customers who may be 
            interested in additional products and more effectively target their marketing efforts.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong style="color: #8f30dc;">Healthcare</strong> - Healthcare providers use CRM software to collect 
            and consolidate patient information. This helps the organization better understand a patient’s profile, 
            and to automate and customize their communications for each patient.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong style="color: #8f30dc;">Real estate</strong> - Real estate companies work with clients who 
            come and go and inventory that changes in quantity and quality. A CRM system can help them keep track 
            of their clients’ needs to help match a client to an appropriate property, store any relevant documents, 
            and monitor where they are in the decision process to follow up appropriately.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>
          The Benefits of Customer Relationship Management Software
        </h4>

        <p>
          Useful for many contexts and applications, CRM systems have advantages such as:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Streamline the sales process to shorten the time to closing.
          </li>

          <li>
            Track a customer’s purchase history – what they bought, when, the price paid, etc.
          </li>

          <li>
            Recognize sales trends to understand purchasing patterns.
          </li>

          <li>
            Find new customers and identify sales opportunities.
          </li>

          <li>
            Speed up response time to improve customer satisfaction.
          </li>

          <li>
            Document service issues and provide support.
          </li>

          <li>
            Segment customer data for more targeted marketing.
          </li>

          <li>
            Automate sales and marketing activities.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>
          The differences between SRM and CRM software
        </h3>

        <p>
          Companies that need to implement a dedicated stakeholder engagement tool might be tempted to customize 
          their existing CRM software for stakeholder management. It may seem like a practical shortcut to tweak 
          the system you already have, instead of investing time and money in something new. After all, some tracking 
          functions are similar, the system is already in place, and users know how to use it. 
          <br><br>
          SRM and CRM software do share certain benefits. Both systems can:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Centralize data to foster better collaboration within an organization.
          </li>

          <li>
            Ensure that everyone has access to information that’s complete, accurate, and up-to-date – from any location.
          </li>

          <li>
            Integrate other tools and applications for greater efficiency.
          </li>

          <li>
            Facilitate sharing of documents and templates.
          </li>

          <li>
            Track and respond to concerns and complaints.
          </li>

          <li>
            Automate manual tasks so teams can focus on human interactions, instead of managing data.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          While at first glance, it may seem that CRM software can be repurposed for stakeholder engagement, this 
          is rarely an acceptable solution. Despite their similarities, the two systems are designed for very 
          different purposes. Let’s take a closer look:
