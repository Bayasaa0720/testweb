          <h2>Acqueon and Cresta Team Up to Create a “New Tier of Customer Engagement Technology”</h2>
  
          <p class="pub-date">Published: March 27, 2024</p>
        </div>
  
        <div class="news-desc">
  
          <div class="news">
            <img src="../BiyeDaalt/img/news4.jpg" alt="news">
  
            <p>
              Acqueon and Cresta have pooled their resources to launch a solution with the power to unlock 
              “a new tier of AI-enabled customer engagement technology.”
              <br><br>
              The tool combines Acqueon and Cresta’s respective expertise in real-time revenue execution and 
              GenAI-powered conversational intelligence to help B2C enterprises optimize customer 
              interactions and generate more revenue.
              <br><br>
              The unified solution – Acqueon Guidance powered by Cresta – also promises to deliver impactful 
              recovery outcomes and strengthen customer service and retention by utilizing omnichannel 
              outbound engagement.
              <br><br>
              The pair of tech companies believe that their new solution will provide users with the 
              capabilities to be proactive with their customer engagements – contacting them at the 
              customers’ convenience and via their preferred channels.
              <br><br>
              In discussing the launch of Acqueon Guidance powered by Cresta, Ping Wu – CEO of Cresta – 
              commented on the potential of the new solution:
              <br><br>
              “Customers are holding businesses to higher standards than ever before, and it’s essential 
              that we ensure that every customer touchpoint is productive and positive.
            </p>

            <p class="highlighted-p">
              The power of Cresta and Acqueon’s solutions will unlock a new tier of AI-enabled customer 
              engagement technology that helps businesses drive deeper connections with core customers, 
              ultimately improving retention and driving revenue growth.
            </p>

            <p>Let’s take a closer look at the tech and see whether it lives up to its “new tier” billing.</p>

            <h4>Stronger Together</h4>

            <p>
              Like gin and tonic, red wine and steak, and Simon and Garfunkel – as good as some things are 
              on their own, sometimes they just work better together.
              <br><br>
              While both systems utilize no-code tools to help prioritize rapid deployment and management 
              of system operations, the partnership enhances this by enabling data sharing between the 
              platforms.
              <br><br>
              Together, the overall effectiveness of the solution is improved, and the customer experience 
              is simplified.
              <br><br>
              Both companies also promise that the collaborative solution enables organizations to enhance 
              customer engagement, personalize experiences, and alleviate the development workload on IT 
              and analyst teams by utilizing the combined no-code approach.
              <br><br>
              In providing further insights into the new solution, Koul again emphasized the power of the 
              partnership between Acqueon and Cresta, commenting:
              <br><br>
              “Understanding the right timing, channel, and message are essential to getting the most out 
              of customer interactions.
            </p>

            <p class="highlighted-p">
              Acqueon and Cresta together can provide enterprises with AI technology that will unlock new 
              ways to engage with consumers to dramatically improve the enterprise’s revenue generation 
              and revenue recovery results.
            </p>

            <h4>A New Regime at Cresta</h4>

            <p>
              The partnership with Acqueon is the latest update in a busy period for Cresta.
              <br><br>
              In May of last year, the company revealed that it would be using its GenAI capabilities to 
              integrate Medallia’s experience insights and sentiment data as part of a new collaboration 
              with the CX and EX specialist.
              <br><br>
              Moreover, in the same month, former Google AI executive Ping Wu was announced as Cresta’s new 
              CEO.
              <br><br>
              Wu co-founded Google’s Contact Center AI Solution in 2017, where he oversaw the development 
              of various Conversational AI products.
              <br><br>
              In his new role at Cresta, Wu led the introduction of several new solutions and enhancements 
              to the Cresta Real-Time Intelligence Platform in March, aimed at assisting companies in 
              increasing revenue and customer retention.
              <br><br>
              These include Cresta Sales for Revenue Growth, Cresta Post-Call, and enhancements to the 
              Cresta Intelligent Automation solution.
              <br><br>
              Cresta’s impressive list of achievements under Wu’s stewardship led to the company being 
              crowned the Rising Star in the People & Transformation category of the 2024 CX Awards.
