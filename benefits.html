    <h3>What are the benefits of using a CRM?</h3>

    <p>
      Now that we’ve seen how widely used CRMs are, let’s take a look at why so many businesses use them. What are 
      the benefits of having a CRM? What kinds of results do they drive? Find out with these eight stats.
    </p>

    <h4>
      1. 74% of businesses say CRM software gives them improved access to customer data.
    </h4>

    <p>
      One of the first benefits a lot of companies say they get from their CRMs is better access to customer data. 
      In fact, that’s basically the main function of a CRM — to let you gather and analyze data about your 
      customers. That helps you better understand (and sell to) your audience.
    </p>

    <h4>
      2. 47% of businesses say that CRM software has a significant impact on customer retention.
    </h4>

    <p>
      Understanding your customers better makes it easier for you to retain them for the long term, because you 
      know exactly which of their needs you need to meet. So, it shouldn’t be surprising that nearly half of all 
      businesses say their CRMs help them retain a lot more customers.
    </p>

    <h4>
      3. Report accuracy can increase by as much as 42% when businesses use CRM software.
    </h4>

    <p>
      One of the main things businesses use CRMs for is report generation. A good CRM can compile customer data 
      into helpful reports that let you visualize customer patterns and trends. And one of the best things about 
      those reports is that they can be as much as 42% more accurate than reports made without a CRM.
    </p>

    <h4>
      4. Sales forecasting accuracy can increase by as much as 42% when businesses use CRM technology.
    </h4>

    <p>
      In addition to standard reporting capabilities, CRMs have a highly accurate rate of sales forecasting. 
      That means they’re perfect for helping you figure out what sorts of sales trends to expect down the road, 
      allowing you to better plan out your budget.
    </p>

    <h4>
      5. CRM software can increase conversion rates by as much as 300%.
    </h4>

    <p>
      Because CRMs are so great for helping you learn more about your audience, they’re also great for helping you 
      drive more leads and sales among that audience. With the help of a good CRM, you can triple the number of 
      conversions you drive with your marketing campaigns.
    </p>

    <h4>
      6. Revenue can increase by as much as 245% when businesses use a CRM platform.
    </h4>

    <p>
      Another metric that CRMs can help increase is revenue. That probably isn’t surprising, since we just 
      established that CRMs drive more leads and sales. Still, knowing that CRMs can earn as much as 245% more 
      money for your business is a pretty big selling point.
    </p>

    <h4>
      7. Lead cost can reduce by as much as 23% when businesses use a CRM platform.
    </h4>

    <p>
      Not only do CRMs help you make more money, but they can also help you spend less money. Using a CRM allows 
      you to target a more precise audience, reducing wasted marketing and ad spend. The result is that it costs a 
      lot less to generate leads.
    </p>

    <h4>
      8. The average ROI of CRM is $8.71 for every $1 spent.
    </h4>

    <p>
      CRMs cost money. So, who’s to say that you’ll end up earning back more money than you spend? Well, the 
      stats certainly indicate that you will. In fact, on average, CRMs help businesses earn $8.71 for every 
      dollar spent on the tool.
